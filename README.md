# Summary

I built this solution with a MERN stack to approximate what you are using in your environment.
I used NextJS because I haven't had the opportunity to work with it very much, and when I do this type of assignment, I like to use it as an opportunity to learn.

## Instructions

### Local

To run the server locally, check readme file in server directory.
To run the client, check data-tables directory for

### Deployment

To deploy, follow instructions from your favourite service and deploy the server and client (data-tables) directories

### Limitations

The database will handle 200k records and as it is noSQL. To accomodate a larger dataset than the example provided, the API will need some modifications, as well as the front end. You can add parameters like offset and limit, and you can leverage some MongoDB functionality as well to reduce the amount of records being returned. For the purposes of this assignment, I have left these additions out of scope and would rank them as high priority on the backlog for an upcoming sprint.
